            "Error processing text: warning does contain spoilersopen your eyesif you have not seen this film and plan on doing so just stop reading here and take my word for it you have to see this film i have seen it four times so far and i still havent made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film then stop reading right nowif you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you thinki remember my grade  english teacher quite well his name was mr krisak to me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you werent all too keen on if we didnt like shakespeare then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it our class room was never a room it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time this was his own indelible way of branding something into our spongelike minds i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind like the phone number of a long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix now if i didnt know better i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr krisak but giving them the benefit of the doubt well assume it wasnt him but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real show me how you can tell that you are real this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that im sure you can imagine everything from pain to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real after every scenario that we gave him he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechlesswhat if you are nothing but someone elses dreamwhat if you were someone elses dream what a messed up question that is this was a questionscenario posed to us about  years ago before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers how possible could it seem back then but if you look at todays technology now ask yourself what it you were a part of someone elses dreamanother brilliant but surreal film this year david lynchs mulholland drive explored similar areas but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to in short this is one film that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround youopen your eyestom cruise plays david aames a young hot shot righteous full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy his board of governers the seven dwarfs think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them early in the film we meet one of davids gorgeous toys named julie gianni played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz david and julie play a good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous committed relationship this is the type of relationship commensurate with davids other flings hes had in the sexual prime of his life and although both talk a good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth next we meet brian shelby played with a stroke of genius by kevin smiths good buddy jason lee brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again and that is  the sweet aint so sweet without the bitter he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or twoat davids huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday brian enters with his date sofia sorrano played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another and in typical david fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with sofia to complicate things julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david david then spends the night with sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another there is no hanky panky the next day as david is leaving sofias apartment he is greeted by julie who offers him a ride and from therewell i think we have all seen the commercialsthat is all i will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze there is a subtext of death and possible panacealike curealls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesnt end therelike many movies seem to thrive on today this film has a secret sixth sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze regardless of how it originated vanilla sky has one of its own surreptitious gut busters and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up something more i can understand to be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film all of the ersatz so called best pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular they lack substance a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who dont like it dont quite understand it this is what film making is supposed to be like this is what a film is supposed to do to you it is supposed to make you feel something most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces this one isnt out of  the best film of the year i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress diaz for best supporting cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor cameron crowe should there as well none of this may come to pass and that is a shame this is one film that should not be missed and on a final note i am quite sure mr krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question can you prove you are real or are we just a figment of someones imagination are we artificially transplanted for someone elses bemusement this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers and im sure that is just fine with himopen your eyes, Error: The size of tensor a (1612) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: thirty years after its initial release the third version of a star is born finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem woman in the moon from this  film easy to dismiss the movies careerpolarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywoodstyle clichs that variations of it exist in other films including streisands own funny girl this time reset to the thencontemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows selfdestructive rock star john norman howard on his deepdive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big breaktroubles dog their courtship from the outset as john norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution to john norman esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the faade in the movies most pivotal scene he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off inevitably he cant handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest directed by frank pierson although streisands budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flawsalthough streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporaryoriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos she cant help but come across as an established star i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john normans woes become overwhelming this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esthers response to it this is capped off by an uninterrupted eightminute closeup of her memorial performance  great except when she regrettably mimics john normans style toward the endkristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love pride and resentment toward esther he makes his vodkasoaked onstage growling work within this context otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didnt exist unless they were interacting with the two principals the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john normans levelheaded manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print a big seller in its day the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the s  some songs still quite good everything woman in the moon watch closely now some that have moved to kitsch queen bee kenny loggins i believe in love and of course the inescapable evergreenthe print transfer on the  dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering streisands participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her featurelength commentary she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movies producer and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director i just wish she could have provided more scenespecific comments that directly relate to what is on screen she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her eg it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from herthere is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing s clothes especially kristoffersons mixedfabric poncho and orange polyester shirt there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisands optional commentary one is a comic breadbaking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies another is an extended scene in which she plays evergreen on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts which i agree with streisand should have been used fittingly the theatrical trailers for all three versions of a star is born are also included, Error: The size of tensor a (1039) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

k red light village in the movie holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their stubbornness but this is all disrupted when holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears as movie goers we are then thrust into patricks pursuit to find holly again holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong holly carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protectionholly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest such as documentaries that involve year olds and sexual trafficking but does manage to shed considerable light on cambodian  vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrongpatrick the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights while on a journey his motorbike runs out of fuel and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel during his stay he comes across holly a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding he discovers a clever stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her  though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet when she suddenly disappears he starts a journey to track her down without having thought if he can really help herholly is able to escape on her way to another brothel when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead so holly is then left on her own during patricks journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the cambodian region the idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand she explains  children in prostitution in cambodia  next year it could be  im not trying to save  he tells her im trying to save one patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and although it takes five minutes to save a child it takes five years to reintegrate her into society patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find hollythe audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children she is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her she is willing to yum yum and boom boom her distant friend patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world in the end he steals her away and brings her to a safeland in the comfort of the social worker holly is given fresh clothes if feed and brought to a dance class but she is forbidden to see patrick this intense yearning to be in the comfort of patricks friendship she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodiameanwhile patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia his thoughts continue to revert back to holly and during a visit to a bar an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her this enrages patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar eventually patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly who is hiding behind a polethe movie holly may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region but the films dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference overall i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle but in the end the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation does nothing to help the childrens situations, Error: The size

            "Error processing text: while the original  version with preston foster was good theres no remake more worthy than this  one or more impossible to find anywhere just as i strongly suspect mickey rooney to have had something to do with that never could a mere performance have ever been so masterfully brilliant or a script more thoughtprovoking as well as an improvement upon the original many years after the last of my several viewings of this film in  i read an article in which mickey rooney was recounting a visit hed made to death row and which had apparently very drastically eliminated whatever sense of personal identification hed felt with people in similar circumstances the article was about as short as the main character here and didnt cover much other than the extent to which his extreme disillusionment with the quality of the inmates themselves had been emphasized even in language i would not care to explicitly quote here     one of my main problems with capital punishment is that of course it is not evenly impartially applied just as many innocent people are fartoocarelessly thus unnecessarily sent to meet this particular fate another problem i have with it is that it is not applied swiftly enough or for that matter even publicly enough the bible makes a special point in such cases about one of the more important purposes of such as a deterrent being ineffectually obscured minus not only a public viewing but also the direct participation of all as for those who claim to prove statistically that such is not an effective deterrent in addition to having a problem about the reliability of their data i have little if any objectively disprovable doubt many are behind bars now due to the extent that such a deterrent is lacking however i do have a problem about the fact that robert duvall in the apostle had been punished at all for his particular crime or that the only hope of leniency for one such as he would have to be based on a temporary insanity defense as though that would serve as the only acceptable excuse in his kind of case    in addition to various other questions concerning the motives of mickey rooney for that particular visit hed recounted and about the answers to which i can only try to speculate i suspect the main one had been of a decidedly religious nature i dont know exactly when hed become the professing christian he now makes it a special point whenever possible to emphasize that he is but as anybody should be wellaware this particular category of people tends to be the most vehemently out for blood when it comes to extracting an eye for an eye however i have no particular bone of contention concerning that per se just as theres no doubt scripturally speaking that not all and perhaps not even most shall be spared the same ultimate fate at the hands of the lord himself as a result of his sacrifice on the cross however there is a problem for me about the spirit or attitude with which most professing christians emphasize their enthusiasm for capital punishment for contrary to the lord himself who would love to see everybody saved ezekiel  ii peter  they seem to go vindictively out of their way to find reasons to condemn    what most people on either side of this superlatively everburning issue cannot appear to sufficiently appreciate is that the lord is as dynamically and elusively soft in nature as he is hard the two sides of his nature appear to be so inherently incompatible as to render him mentally deranged at least by any strictly human reckoning yet regardless of how harrowingly ungraspable this miraculously dynamic blending of the water and oil in his nature surely is there can be no doubt that anything short of it or anything fanatically and characteristically on either one side or the other of this equation falls inadequately and unacceptably short of the entire judicial truth indeed ive seen the most bloodcurdling thirst for the same come out selfcontradictorily enough on fartoomany occasions whenever the categorically antideath penalty advocates are confronted even in the most rationally wellbalanced ways with the fact that although the lord died for everybody not all are thereby going to be saved afterall in order to receive absolution one must to repeat the same term reach out and receive it that is repent luke  could anything make more sense    but then what about the lords command to forgive even in the case of ones enemies of those who despise and persecute you without a just cause or provocation one of the fartooprevailing difficulties with this kind of sentimentality as popularly misinterpreted is the way it obscuringly oversimplifies the real meaning of forgiveness the act of forgiveness does not in itself mean the same thing as unconditionally excusing the one being forgiven when one takes a clearly sober rationally wellbalanced view here from the perspective of gods own attitude all it actually amounts to is a fervent wish that the one forgiven will ultimately succeed at finding his way seeing the light and being granted mercy this attitude is of course the very opposite of say that of jonah who actually resented it when god told him that his preaching to the people of nineveh would result in their repentance jonah didnt want them to repent but vindictively desired that they be destroyed how selfrighteously coldbloodedly like unto most professing christians he was save that even his reasons were undoubtedly better than most i envy jonah almost as much as he would me however minus the repentance of the one being forgiven any forgiveness he may receive from a genuine christian is not going to do him any good in such a case the only one to benefit is the real christian himself,

            "Error processing text: director douglas sirk once said theres a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art this statement defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramassirks melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music the music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screenturnedcanvas but this aint life but its representation an imitation of life sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood most notably technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing lets remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama blackboard jungle rebel without a cause sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something elseanother of sirks statements summarizes this you cant reach or touch the real you just see reflections if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen one ends up giving uptherefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where theres no difference between real and its false copy nobody can say that the hadley are real people that town aint real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place so in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower for example sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same timethe angles are the directors thoughts the lighting is his philosophy in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows the hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way a house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night sirks photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the directors craftsirk considered himself a story bender because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose written on the wind is a good example it wouldnt work in any other handsthe other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin who was for s comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising tv sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay im inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences the game was played by both sides so it was camp now we regard them as cult or bizarre because we are not those spectators anymore that is why todd hayness homage far from heaven turns into a pastiche because it reproduces sirks work nowadays as if nothing happened in between then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned filmsirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly there were always immovable characters rock hudson and lauren bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones sirk is interested in too when robert stack flies the plane and tempts lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the riverin the sirks universe the studio oftenimposed happy ends have no negative impact in fact they worked just great sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feudit was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga i absolutely agree and im sure the parallel is not incidental both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caans sonny corleone the action of fighting her sisters male friend is symmetrical the nonson in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork because both films deal with the subject of power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even kyle hadleys sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power in this case a weakness in sexual power the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane one wouldnt think at first of similarities between welles and sirks films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the familys fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne rock hudson as charles foster kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive amazingly the same actor harry shannon perform both wayne and kanes fathers this detail is cannot be a coincidencewritten on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director some say that this is his best film in my opinion magnificent obsession all that heaven allows theres always tomorrow and imitation of life are just as good and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end, Error: The size of tensor a (1248) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

the beach the basic story is of what happens to simons love life but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignetteswhen they arrive at the beach both simon and marcie appear bored with each other marcie sees them as a romeo and juliet romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to gail bonniejaye lawrence paula zara collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing gails chances of finding the perfect man aided by the powers of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them attractive and young part of the realism of this filmto service the beachs patrons there is a flatulent shortsighted icecream salesperson with a van this is ben gary waddell who is a friend of simon and is also his unofficial counsellor i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud unless you were intoxicated male and very young maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is variable the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive boon in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its bluntness and downright aussie attitude to carnal mattersthe camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and pans of the beach cliffs and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of gratuity in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on private body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subjects personal space and makes the film more tasteful not an easy task given the location for filmingmaslin beach is neither a skin flick for postpubescent testosterone charged males nor a mills and boon romance for underappreciated women maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not attractive in the baywatch sense and are just normal people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement other than perhaps to naturists apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema verite and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a rash option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity and a flop is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that maslin beach is now a collectors item that the film might become internationally popular but it is very unlikelyduring this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about maslin beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the crest of the hyperreal actiondramaangst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality maslin beach is not exactly jacques tati either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism equality gender orientation and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am sure that you will either love or hate this film with little room for a middle ground, Error: The size of tensor a (1013) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: this comment does contain spoilersthere are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma panache and swagger its the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooneys subtle touches in scenes like his one word goodbye to andy garcia in oceans  when they just utter each others name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jacks performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lees film of the same name you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i dont mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzels work but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw emotional and incendiary all at the same timewashington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor played very reservedly by christopher walken is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former seals and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i dont know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the films entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the roleit is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film domino turns out i think scott is one of todays under rated directors and with more films like this one his name will surely be elevated to icon statusthe story has creasy really taking to pita and visca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy its not just a friendship between them it is more of a kinship and a deep parental love seems to be present the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzels anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pitas violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind also what is paramount to this films audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasys wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the filmman on fire is one the five best films of  now that it is out on dvd my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about  hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks , Error:

            "Error processing text: after witnessing his wife linda hoffman engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy the already somewhat unstable dentist dr feinstone corbin bernsen completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patientsthis delightful semioriginal and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties although the dentist is intended to be a cheesy fun little film yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days the movie is intriguing generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest even during the more ludicrous of moments the dentist suffers on occasion from dragging but unlike the much inferior  sequel there are only sporadic uninteresting moments and in general the movie follows itself nicelycorbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic deranged and perfectionist dr alan feinstone the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex particularly fellatio is something short of marvellous while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable had the dentist not been intended to be a fun almost comical horror movie bernsens performance would probably have been much more powerful sadly the rest of the cast including a prefame mark ruffalo failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flickthe dentist is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable particularly i would presume for fans of cheesy horror those who became annoyed at the number of scream  clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change as i did a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the s on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and on the whole realistic scenes of dental torture which should keep most gorehounds happy far from perfect but far from bad as well the dentist is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once my rating for the dentist  , Error: The size of tensor a (517) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regardsmuch the best drama of the piece is in the midsection and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept sciencefiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously overthetop as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardsons mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond masseys aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the smallfry nature of his kingdom its not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of iteverytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasnt got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedgedbet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say its not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in  well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly  years mind a nuclear bomb  the super gun or some such contraption  in  a technocratic socialist we dont believe in independent nation statestype government in britain after  hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps  no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable antiwar sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship  whether boneheadedludditefascist as under the boss or allhandstothepump scientific socialism  will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in  there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out  or even how they were turning out  the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other mattersmuch of the earlier stuff should  and could  have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from  would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardsonmassey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashingeyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isnt explored but then this was the s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightlyi would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in  one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous yet the script is ultimately overearnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this  they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first ratethings to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis tis much as silly in wells words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it, Error:

            "Error processing text: this film in my opinion is despite its flaws which i maintain are few an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of artwhat mr bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films he does not receive th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience if it were not for mr bakshi i dont believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught what is more with the lord of the rings he has not only created a beautiful animated film but he has created an entirely new art form  unfortunately one that never quite made it off the groundmost people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm no this is not disney animation no its not live action no its not cheating  what it is is a new fascinating and absolutely wonderful art form something so fresh and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as the lord of the rings bakshis pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way in particular the darker of tolkiens creatures particularly the nazgul are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplishpeter s beagles screenplay based very little as i understand it on an early draft by chris conkling is a very loyal adaptation of tolkiens works where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and  into a single  hour  minute film but there are very few changes to the storyline there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled the reforging of narsil the gifts of galadriel the huorns at the battle of the hornburg but again with the time limitations he had already the longest animated feature in history these are certainly understandable though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequelalso there is the delightful one of my favorites score by leonard rosenman who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work it is bombastic and audacious and dare i say perfect it stands on its own as an orchestral triumph but when coupled with the images of the film it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people offthe voice actors are wonderful of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of striderthe character design is also wonderfully unique though not often to everyones taste but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what heshe imagines not what you might have imagined and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb this is perhaps not what you imagined but i can only applaud mr bakshi for showing us what he saw it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the filmone farther word  the flight to the ford sequence in my opinion is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build bakshis artistic ability and tolkiens incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaledthe recent dvd release  by warner brothers is sorely lacking while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format the package is woefully short of extras how glorious it would have been to have had a directors commentary been able to see the  minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the scoreof course the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made we will never be able to see bakshis interpretation of gondor of shelob of faramir of the cracks of doom of eowyns battle with the witch king or gandalfs confrontation with him we will never be graced with bakshis image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead it is a shame beyond all shames that we will in the end have to accept peter jacksons glitz and glitter hollywood action film version of these later events in tolkiens masterpiece but i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at alldavid, Error: The size of tensor a (1043) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: peter jacksons versions are better films overall from objective point of view that being said they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings and let me explain why firstly the acting of the onscreen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jacksons lotr the whole cast is too run of the mill are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask well they are not really sillysave for hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than jacksons party  even with much more limited dialogue time and that is because of superior voice acting of the bakshis lotr take aragorn for example in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authorityaragorn the lordand with a seasoned rasparagorn the ranger this is due to john hurts brilliant voice acting compare that to viggo mortensens rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven hurt beats mortensen hands down and then there is gandalf probably the most dominatingand the most popular character in the whole saga in this bakshi version gandalfwilliam squire is a real wizard and by that i dont mean he shoots bolts from his fingertipshe does not but his presence is just captivating he is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease add to that his looks tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat a perfect gandalf just like in the books ian mckellens gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring he looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword yes a sword in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his swordas he did in the books and those are stylish slow motion kills gandalf is not a power to be messed with and it must be noted that while im sad to say this the great christopher lee didnt bring saruman alive fraser kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and linesbefore i move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jacksons pretendeous bad guys bakshis orcs taunt their enemiesor each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion and finally the black riders  or the nazgul those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one  not just some riders wearing black and they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river while peter jackson couldnt do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering skybut as much i like this film more than jacksons the latter are if only technically still better and that is because of some key visuals as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated charactersall hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint i dont really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just dont fit very well with traditional cartoon figures this is especially true with humansriders of rohan tavern people etc orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to jacksons version they have brownishgreen skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the hobbits while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson the latter has clearly superior hobbits in fact they are perfect with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned again the voice acting is ok with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels well i never really liked those halflings anyway general failures in the bakshi script are well known limited playing timewith limited budget and a lot of missing scenes so while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesnt do it in extensive detail compared to jacksons version in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superioroverall atmosphere it feels more like middleearth overall voice acting music i really dig the fantasy score by kont  rosenman gandalf aragorn one of the john hurts finest roles king theoden orcs black riders elrond hes not some fairy hippie in this onewhile jackson version is betterbecause it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects gollumsmeagol balrog hobbitslord of the rings by ralph bakshi even with its well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkiens fantasy world very well if not perfectly ill give it a score of  out of , Error: The size of

            "Error processing text: with the release of peter jacksons famed lord of the rings trilogy it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshis  animated lord of the rings film as inferior i agree with the majority that jacksons trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkiens work but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshis ambitious pioneering effort jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshis film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptationsthe films colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive but these points didnt bother me very much however the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie the only character representation i was bothered by was sams he was made to look unbecomingly sillythis film is novel for its animation techniques in addition to handdrawn characters live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping it is quite apparent which characters are handdrawn and which are rotoscoped but none the less i found that the films style was a novelty the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out wellthe voice acting was generally of high quality particularly good was john hurt who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn aragorn isnt a favorite character of mine from the stories but backed by john hurts voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation my other favorite was william squire whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam whose voice acting was irritating and added to sams unfortunately silly image the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as arumanin producing this film ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films hence this film contains about half the story from the start of the fellowship of the ring to the end of the battle at helms deep in the two towers the obvious implication of this is that the films story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations but the liberties taken to compress the story didnt bother me even the choice to leave arwen out of the story enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in  minutes the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helms deep were tremendousralph bakshis version of the lord of the rings isnt perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story however for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this first great tale of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel, Error: The size of tensor a (665) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",
            "Error processing text: i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv long before a liveaction version was so much as a twinkle in peter jacksons eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isnt that just par for the course i had the chance to revisit this film and found that it still stands up quite well although its not quite the success that memory had paintedi have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jacksonlovers others as jacksonhaters im not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in  and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here  peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost noteperfect for the radio three years lateri must say however that where i found jacksons films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action the only exception to the latter as others have remarked is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell where the ringwraiths having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in midflight  which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river  then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop which is initially nightmarish but pointless plotwise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory due partly to bad animation and that gandalf windmills his arms too muchbut having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is halfmyth oddly enough one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorns story of beren and luthien the extreme literalism required by liveaction filming where everything from monsters to mailshirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counterproductive latexfaced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than sketchilydrawn shapes heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and hobbits or dwarfs with nonhuman body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods with its crippled halfhuman movements as one of the scariest moments in the film  it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the darkthe extreme stylisation of the introduction plus a voiceover done with great skill and economy to sum up the backstory in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comicbook rusticism of the shire  i particularly like the proudfeet  corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkiens prose i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes bilbo seeming to become a gollumlike creature under the influence of ringlust at rivendell and galadriels famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits changed perceptions but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette  firelight hues at bree bright colours reemerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands  work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a liveaction approach simply doesnt allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised settingas a fan i didnt care for either jacksons or bakshis depiction of lothlorien  again i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation ive come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time  and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria aragorn giving a hobbitfencinglesson here is as charming and equally uncanonical a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson versionthe depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film viggo mortensens scruffy jesus look really didnt work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to clean up the character in the second half for gondors benefit john hurt unsurprisingly gives a sterling vocal performance as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf the hobbits are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audienceidentification figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more cartoonish than those of the human characters works well to differentiate them and the whole hairy feet thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions including much fan artpersonally i have less objection to boromir as viking  he was always a fairly bludgeoning type  than to beardyaragorn illogical they were both numenorians after all although i am clearly in a minority herethe big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project with a bizarre tackedon voiceover ending attempting to resolve matters a pity it would have been interesting not to mention less frustrating to see what bakshi planned to make of shelob and minas tirith never mind the dead, Error: The size of tensor a (1185) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

it is in fact one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan as played by clint eastwood so popular he carries a badge and works within the law but at heart harry is a vigilante meting out justice his way which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors as well as the criminals hes pursuing but its what draws the audience anyone whos ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it even if its only on the screen and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done and quickly is one of the elements that makes sudden impact directed by and starring eastwood so successful in this one the fourth of the series while working a homicide harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own with one exception whoever it is hes definitely not carrying a badgein his own inimitable way inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time so he does as only dirty harry can in a small town north of san francisco harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique mo employed by the perpetrator unaccountably harry encounters resistance from the local police chief jannings pat hingle who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere not one to be deterred however harry continues his investigation which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist jennifer spencer sondra locke gradually harry discovers a link between the victims the burning question though is where does jennifer spencer fit into the pictureeastwood is in top form here both in front of and behind the camera and it is arguably the second best of the fivefilm series right behind the original dirty harry it had been seven years since the last harry offering the enforcer  but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor and this one definitely benefits from having him in the directors chair as he is able to recapture the essence of not only his own character but that spirit that made these films so successful and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between s  and  as with all the films he directs eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end the screenplay by joseph stinson is well written and formulated to that distinctive dirty harry style the dialogue is snappy and the story itself conceived by charles b pierce and earl e smith is the most engaging since the original dirty harry as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama rather than entirely upon the action the characters are well drawn and convincing and of course this is the film that gave us one of harrys best catchphrases go ahead make my dayas harry clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular he lives by a personal moral code a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear possibly more so today than ever before no matter who we are or where we come from theres undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry or at least have him around dirty harry is an icon of the cinema and its impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him for better or worse eastwood is dirty harry without question just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone sherlock holmessondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer a young woman wronged and out for vengeance or as she sees it justice she manages to bring a hardedged determination laced with vulnerability to her character with a convincing introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the action genre even amid the violence locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwoods harry and becomes in philosophy and deed something of his counterpartin supporting roles two performances stand out paul drake as mick creates the best psycho since andy robinsons dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original dirty harry with actually very limited screen time drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience this is the guy you cant wait to see harry take care of in the end also effective is audrie j neenan who makes her character ray parkins the epitome of the proverbial low life who can be found in any bar in any city its a performance that evokes a gutlevel response and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realismthe supporting cast includes albert popwell horace mark kevloun bennett and nancy parsons mrs kruger with a perfect blend of drama and action sudden impact dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality the perfect justice of a notsoperfect world that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience , Error: The size of tensor a (1093)

            "Error processing text:  and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade now that it had become the site of a multimillion dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established some of those in the calmer quarters of this filmmaking factory were taking the time for a little selfreflection the last command while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal it was written by lajos biro who had been on the scene long enough to knowtaking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywoods most celebrated immigrants  emil jannings before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy being a master of the hammy yet hilariously welltimed performance often as pompous authority figures or doddering old hasbeens he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter and at first it looks as if this is to be another of janningss scenerychomping caricatures however as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range showing by turns delicate frailty serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performancethe director was another immigrant albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister the von was made up by the way and took a very distinctive approach to the craft of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes we open with a carefullyconstructed chaos with movement in converging directions which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen then when jannings arrives everything settles down janningss performance is incredibly sedate and measured and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored ordersternberg appears to show a distaste for violence allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic in fact he really seems to have an allround lack of interest in action in the scene of the prisoners revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance his camera eventually retreating to a flyonthewall position compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent which are a complex medley of pointofview shots and intense closeups thrusting us right into the midst of their interactionas a personality on set it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell and in fact powells portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically it appears noone told his costars they were not in a comedy evelyn brent is fairly good giving us some good emoting but overplaying it here and there the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself its a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless like a male ninotchka but he does a good job revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hardhearted exteriorthe last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the filmmaking process even a relatively tame example like this at the very least i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the behindthescenes view as it threatened the mystique of moviemaking which was still very much alive at this point as it turned out such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and according to some sources although the issue is a little vague a nomination for best picture this is significant since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of selfindulgent backslapping by the hollywood elite but elite or not they recognised good material when they saw it and were willing to reward it, Error: The size of tensor a (969) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism the highly atmospheric style of filmmaking developed during the s in berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari  and nosferatu eine symphonie des grauens  were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didnt have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener director of s der golem wie er in die welt kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally another horror film der student von pragder student von prag the student of prague is the story of balduin paul wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague but who always find himself with financial troubles one day balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit grete berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that hell have to compete with her rich cousin graf von schwarzenberg lothar krner who also wants to marry her knowing that he cant offer her much balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli john gottowt enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirrorloosely inspired by edgar allan poes short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduinwhile der student von prag was paul wegeners directorial debut and stellan ryes second film as a filmmaker its very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seebers cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with balduins reflection played by wegener too already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakersas balduin paul wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie it certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one cant deny that wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract john gottowt plays the sinister scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove few is said about scapinelli in the film but gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared the rest of the main cast is less lucky with grete berger being pretty much average as countess margit and lothar krner making a poor graf von schwarzenberg however it must be said that lyda salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and fritz weidemann made an excellent baron waldisschwarzenberg showing the dignity that lrners character should have hadconsidering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made  years after this film is superior in every possible way its not difficult to understand why der student von prag hasnt stood the test of time as well as other early films the movies main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what ewers story needed to be fully developed this makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course theres also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete however der student von prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in historyas the direct predecessor of the german expressionist movement its hard to deny the enormous importance that der student von prag has in the history of german cinema probably in the history of cinema in general it may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had its truly better than most films from that era as the movie that started paul wegeners career and with that german expressionism der student von prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history , Error: The size of

onlyand definitely the first truly claustrophobic games and just a pretty wellrounded gaming experience in general with graphics that are terribly dated today the game thrusts you into the role of bjdont even think im going to attempt spelling his last name an american pow caught in an underground bunker you fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodesbut lets face it most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon surround you with nazis and send you out to waste one of the nazi leaders the graphics are as i mentioned before quite dated and very simple the least detailed of basically any d game released by a professional team of creators if you can get over that howeverand some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you then youve got one heck of a good shootersneaking game the game play consists of searching for keys health and ammo blasting enemiesaforementioned nazis and a boss enemy per chapter of varying difficultywhich of course grows as you move further in the game unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms there is a bonus count after each level is beaten it goes by how fast you werebasically if you beat the par time which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level this can be quite fun to try and beat and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in they are even challenging after many playthroughs how much nazi goldtreasure you collected and how many bad guys you killed basically if you got  of any of aforementioned you get a bonus helping you reach the coveted high score placings the game mostly but not always allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see you can either run or walk and amongst your weapons is also a knife running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard as is gunshots many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them nearly silently in your inventory you can get no less than four weapons and two keys more about the weapons later the keys unlock certain doors most doors in the game arent locked only two kinds need keys and these keys are only introduced in later levelsyou restart in levels resetting weaponry health score and lives in each chapter much of the later game is spent looking for them now as i just alluded to this game like many of the periodlate s early s is based on collecting extra lives personally i think its completely and utterly uselessit was mercifully dropped from here on end i think from the next d shooter and onwards since you can save anytime you want and using a life resets weaponry health and ammo like starting on a new chapterwhich is a real pain in later levels where you need heavier artillery now i shall beat around the bush no longer moving on to the guns you start with aforementioned knifewhich is silent but only effective up close and a pistol nothing special but good for conserving ammo unlike the next two bad boys your third weapon is a german smg a submachinegun its faster and automatic and some later enemies use it and the last one is nothing short of a gatling gun oh yeah think t think predator think about unloading massive amounts of lead into nazi fiends with such a gun its every bit as entertaining as it sounds most of the boss enemies use this though so be prepared i wont reveal the identities of these boss enemies however thats for each player to discover for himor herself the sound is excellent very crisp and realistic as you hear the tear of a machinegun firing the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a nazi yelling surprised or a warning in german you truly feel like you are there trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems that segues me nicely into the level design as you run through seemingly countless nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood i almost got motion sickness more than oncethough that might also have something to do with little sleep lots of humidity and unusual warmth from playing though the level of detail isnt terribly high what there is is great remains of victims guards quarters and countless nazi symbols the list goes on the game also features quite a bit of gore for its limited graphics engine john romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game what is there left to say the first of its kind and its no wonder this spawned countless others d shooters sure weapon bobbing and different height levelsstairs and such didnt come around until the next entry into the genre doom and it was duke nukem d that introduced the feature of switching your viewso it goes beyond simply left and right adding vertical dimensions to it and jumping didnt come around until a third later titlethe first quake possibly fellow gamers help me out here but all of those games as well as the rest of the genre owe their existence to this one so load up the luger open the door to enter the bunker and step into bjs shoes he deserves the recognition evenor maybe even especially nearly fifteen years after he first appeared i recommended this to all fans of d games , Error: The

the least and so it was relying on its b brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on a high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present tlo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyzi am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didnt get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercurys night early we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this rollercoaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory i have been watching wrestling for almost  years and it doesnt get any better than this match unbelievablethe night opened with only the th ever inferno match kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cashs ring of firethe other gimmick match of the night and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown  feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didnt pop for this the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a matchwinning tombstonein other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was a very good bout with benoit hitting  german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submissionanother cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneckthe boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match i hate the boogeyman with a passion only worth listening too for jbls ranting about miz jbl is comedy goldthe last match of the night was main event number  world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabombso  is over for the wwe in regards to its payperview schedule it started the year on a terrible note with new years revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match, Error: The size of tensor a (1068) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton

kane vs mvp wonder why was it the first match on the card i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvps ass on fire as theyre on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling  eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp funny and visually quite entertaining ending wwe tag team championship this was originally supposed to be william regal  dave taylor vs brian kendrick  paul london c in a regular tag team match however gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that its going to be a fatal way tag team ladder match mnm and the hardys are thrown in and its all chaos one word to describe this eyeopener  wow man i really cant remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words cant really do it justice there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a seesaw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill and then wham nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder there were other highflying breathtaking spots too many to remember london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave showstealer the boogeyman vs the miz the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sitout powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the mizs mouth as usual  for this threeminute incognitounited states championship chris benoit c faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not this allows chavo to go for a rollup but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter game over nice hardfought battle albeit slow at times wwe cruiserweight championship gregory helms c vs jimmy wang yang for this one in a fairly moderatepaced match the match had some good highflying spots  most notably helms moves off the top rope  but the crowd didnt seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match and yang needs to get more airborne helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee the undertaker vs mr kennedy in a last ride match after a series of matches between these two this time it is a last ride match the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse pretty good indeed for what these two could offer kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about  feet below and thank god for kennedy otherwise it wouldve been brutal kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse i liked the camera view inside the hearse taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearses window instead but then later busted kennedy open with a chair and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearses roof kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win i actually found myself really interested into these guys willingness to takegive real sick shots santa comes into the ring i go what the hell like many of the kids in the crowd and then the word lingerie contest gets in my ear break timebatista  john cena vs finlay  king booker talk about charisma vs technicality this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time i kind of doubted his strength against the champs and him and booker mainly didnt succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cenas throat batista hits the bomb on booker for the win didnt get to see the fu cena performed the  knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder being an onandoff wwe fan i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eyecatchers throughout and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show the last ride match featured some fairly nervewrenching spots and the main event also did very well for its category all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs the miz bout and the everuseless lingerie contest overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable payperview and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology armageddon wishes this years goodbye respectably ppv rating , Error:

shorts but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features ive seen a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic though hes classified as a neonouvelle vogue his films owe as much to silent cinema as the s experimental narratives his movies are closer to jean vigo in latlante jean cocteau and guy maddin than godard and truffautin boy meets girl caraxs  debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like vigos moviesthe story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to caraxs two following films which comprise this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis lavant who plays a character named alex in caraxs next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friends apartment but avoids contacting either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a suicidal young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part limelightlater he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourselfyoung people today its like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film and how an actor timid off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera heres where the movie tips its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it overlaps the style of the film silent and expressionist with the content a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which arent easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in lovethere is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a childrens show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as carax is selfreflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining infants hes mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silencethough indebted to films before talkies carax is a master of music knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedys holiday in cambodia or an early david bowie song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl softly hummingin boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin  degrees as if attached to a carousel when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance like the famous author who cant speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain or the miss universe of  standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet michel gondry and wes anderson whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional cues in these carax moviesevery line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level some i lack words to articulate there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can wait see this first if i were to make films i would want them to be like this in fact i wish all films were like this where the ephemeral becomes larger than life and life itself becomes a dream, Error: The size of

            "Error processing text: in the same vein as natural born killers another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good david duchovny plays brian kessler an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for i dont know where places where nudity passes for art maybe it really does and i just dont understand it at any rate brian and carrie duchovny and michelle forbes who fits the role flawlessly make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites brian the writer will write the book carrie can take the picturesbeing artistic types brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses and are contacted by early grace and adele corners brad pitt and juliette lewis early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer sees the ad on a bulletin board and decides to leave the state for a while violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlords murder so he wont have to deal with a pesky murder investigation two birds with one stone you knowthe movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash without resorting to clichs or even ending up with caricatures of either type brian and carrie are artsy liberals but while carrie catches on to early and adele brian is fascinated with earlys status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where brian shoots earlys gun never having fired a gun before hes as fascinated as a little kid while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early broke her of smoking and that shes not allowed to drink early doesnt think women should early and brian are out at the local bar brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy hit him bri its comin this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because its so funny what early gleefully says as the guys friends drag him away bloodied and battered but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them and besides that because brian benefited from earlys actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adeleclearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand its a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a crosscountry trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes while studying the actions of past murderers brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when its in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders pasti am constantly amazed at brad pitts versatility as an actor consider for example his roles in movies like kalifornia  monkeys fight club and oceans  and  pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable incidentally i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year but just couldnt get the hair and beard right i even got the hat right which initially i thought would be the hardest partits easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audiences understanding of its subject matter a film that didnt glorify violence at least initially could never be as effective as kalifornia but the movie structures it perfectly the glorification is all embodied in brians and carries fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened but their realization and ours is embodied in the real thing which they encounter with early and adele the movies very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real, Error: The size of tensor a (1001) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when its in the right hands that is  a bugs life is a warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsit is only pixars second animated feature the subgroup of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in  with their landmark movie toy story it was a movie which defied convention reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the filmafter all its a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bugs life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story a bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounternot only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters  but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his anticsthe problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of a better term hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppersif you think about it a bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which a village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in a bugs life the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a barroom brawlmuch amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce a sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen as is the entire movie collectivelyas ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie what makes a bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichd kidfriendly situations are a bit more abundant than wed like however its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this filmalthough a bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still a superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just a onehit wonder but instead a muchgifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves what more is there to say about a bugs life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year  and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature of , Error: The size of tensor a (1115) must match the size of tensor b (512) at

scarletred protoplasm that plummeted to earth in a meteor and menaced everybody in the small town of downingtown pennsylvania on a friday night as the blob steve mcqueen won the role of josh randall the old west bounty hunter in wanted dead or alive after producer dick powell saw this paramount pictures release meanwhile mcqueens attractive girlfriend aneta corsaut went on to star opposite andy griffith in the andy griffith show as sheriff taylors school teacher girlfriend helen crump of course neither mcqueen nor corsaut were teenagers but then rarely did actual teenagers play actual teenagers director irvin s yeaworth jr made his directorial debut with the blob linaker  simonsons screenplay synthesized four genres first the alien invasion second teenage delinquency third a murder mystery and fourth a horror chiller moreover while the gelatinous substance assumes various shapes it remains largely anonymous in other words the eponymous jello neither talks nor communicates by telepathy instead it kills without a qualm and discriminates against nobody the tone of the blob is fairly serious in spite of its somewhat campy natureas the filmmakers point out on the criterion dvd release of the blob the movie opens uncharacteristically for a scifi horror thriller with our hero and heroine in a remote rural locale making out and kissing jane anita corsaut and steve steve mcqueen see a large meteor fall to the earth and drive off to find it meanwhile an old man finds the meteor and prods it with a stick the meteor cracks open and a slimy bunch of goop clings to the stick when the old timer olin howland of the paleface gets a closer look at it the goop attaches itself to his hand the old guy runs screaming from the crater and steve nearly hits him with his jalopy steve and jane pick the guy up and take him to see dr hallen in town hallen is poised to leave town for a medical conference when steve and jane bring the old guy to his office hallen phones his nurse to return since he may need to perform an amputation of course hallen has never seen anything like the substance on the mans forearm hallen sends steve and jane to find out what happened our heroes run into another group of teenagers that ridicule steves fast driving steve fools him into a reverse drive race but the local police chief dave earl rowe lets him off the hook steve and the teenagers visit the site of the meteor crater and find the warm remains of the meteor after they visit the old mans house and rescue a dog the teenagers split for a spooky late night movie while steve and jane

benson believes that it is a prank bert has an axe to grind with teenagers because his wife died when one struck her carsteve and jane take them to hallens office but they can find neither hide nor hair of anybody but dave admits that the office has been vandalized against sgt berts advice dave turns the teens over to their respective parents no sooner have steve and jane fooled their folks into believing that they are snugly asleep in bed than they venture out again they drive into town and spot the old mans dog that got away from them in front of a supermarket when they go to retrieve the mutt steve steps in front of the electric eye door of the grocery store and it opens they find nobody inside but they encounter the blob steve and jane take refuge in a freezer and the blob doesnt

department arrive at the supermarket steve tries to convince dave that the blob is in the store about that time the blob kills the theater projectionist and attacks the moviegoers suddenly a horde of people exit the theater and dave believes steve steve and jane wind up at a lunch counter that the blob attacks the proprietor and our heroes hole up in the cellar and steve discovers that a fire extinguisher with its freezing contents forces the blob to back offthe authorities collect every fire extinguisher in town and manage to freeze the blob the pentagon sends down a team to transport the blob to the north pole as the remains of the blob drift down to the polar ice pack the end credit appears with a ghostly giant question mark producer james b harris obtained stock military footage of a globe master military transport plane depositing the parachute and its cargothe blob proved to be a drivein hit and steve mcqueens surge to stardom gave the film added momentum unless you are a juvenile this little horror movie isnt scary at all but yeaworth and his scenarists create a sufficient amount of paranoia and sympathy for our heroes they never show the blob actually assimilating

identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as  to yuma eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows youre dead is a deviously stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thrillerits one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers namely blood simple and fargo and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling sharp thick and precariously depressing kelly mastersons screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplaybut the film has much more going for it than just its delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is topnotch combining the sizzling dramathriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwellthe screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the films dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leadingman status after his unnaturally fantastic oscarwinning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater grander actors here he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that its watching actors and then theres albert finney such a supple opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that theyre middleaged men and yet despite this it is clear how finneys father favours hawkes younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go bythis film isnt revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the coen brothers and its very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that treads familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to mastersons brilliantly vivid intense and morbidly depressing firsttime screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful resonant intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years, Error: The size of tensor a (1047) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: october sky is a highly lauded movie and its easy to see why the story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper the hero finally gets what he wants and its a true story frankly i think the directors achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates we dont see any special narrative or cinematography the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters we feel homers desire to earn his fathers recognition and create his own future and his resilience wins our respect october sky reminds me of a later  japanese production of mini series rocket boy which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison when october sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny rocket boy offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society starring the outstanding actor yuji oda rocket boy focuses on three men as ordinary as can be a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother like what homer feels in his family and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea the collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them impossible to compensate for his lost ideal kobayashi yuji works in the tour operator because its called galaxy when his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him he finally finds strength from his fathers words who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed but i dont regret it his father told kobayashi at least i tried it is his fathers confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair kobayashis effort finally fails and he goes back to the travel agency but his crazy courage inspires his friends and everyone loves him more just before the end of the series kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts after the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says astronauts wanted for  kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs just like a kid looking at his ticket to disneyland kobayashi may never get what he wants but he dares his destiny and just does it this series is so heartgripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy unlike dilbert or other sarcastic writings this show enlightens us and teaches us something homer and kobayashi both have the dream and they do what they can despite other peoples opinions i recommend other imdb users to see the japanese tv series if you are a ninetofiver you will feel more touched i feel sorry that imdb doesnt have its data maybe you can ask somebody from japan to help you, Error: The size of tensor a (674) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: im sure things didnt exactly go the same way in the real life of homer hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book rocket boys but the movie october sky an anagram of the books title is good enough to stand alone i have not read hickams memoirs but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation the film directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick records the story of teenager homer hickam jake gyllenhaal beginning in october of  it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik the first artificial satellite in orbit we see a images of a bluegray town and its people mostly miners working for the olga coal company one of the miners listens to the news on a handheld radio as he enters the elevator shaft but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness losing sight of the starry sky above him a melancholy violin tune fades with this image we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting october   coalwood west virginia homer and his buddies roy lee cook william lee scott and sherman odell chad lindberg are talking about football tryouts football scholarships are the only way out of the town and working in the mines for these boys why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college questions homer roy lee replies theyre also the only ones who get the girls homer doesnt make it in football like his older brother so he is destined for the mines and to follow in his fathers footsteps as mine foreman until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky then he wants to build a rocket i want to go into space says homer after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mothers natalie canerday fence homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson chris owen quentin asks homer what do you want to know about rockets homer quickly anwers everything his science teacher at big creek high school miss frieda riley laura dern greatly supports homer and the four boys work on building rockets in homers basement his father however whose life is the mine does not support him john hickam chris cooper believes that homer shouldnt waste his time on the rockets that the coal mines are all that matter the coal from the mines is used to make steel and without steel the country would be nothing the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship you cant just dream your way out of coalwood she tells homer homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets improving the models with each attempt despite the many attempts the boys do not lose their determination what are the chances of us winning that science fair odell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments a million to one answers homer that good odell replies well why didnt you say so the music composed by mark isham conveys sadness and hope at the same time especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood rollicking s rock and roll including songs by the coasters and buddy holly occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a lighthearted mood that contrasts the teenagers lives with the lives of the miners the film photographed by fred murphy also uses colors to set moods and symbolize the town of coalwood actually filmed in tennessee is washed with blues grays and browns its as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything faces clothes houses and roads when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red the red stands out enough against the bluegray world of coalwood to symbolize getting out but it is still subtle the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal hope and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isnt the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homers stubborn father who doesnt recognize or just doesnt want to admit that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive homer and everyone who encourages him in his rocketbuilding is aware that the town is dying with the community disintegrating the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys demonstrations again im sure things didnt happen exactly as the movie portrayed them but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism october sky has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real, Error: The size of tensor a (992) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

thescreamonlineso i approached watching this the way id approach doing homeworki was irritated at first the lighting in this version is bad everyone  everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that in some scenes casts shadows on the wall behind the charactersand the sound is poorly recorded i felt like i was listening to a high school playand the pancake makeup is way too heavyand the sets dont fully convey the gothic mood of the novel they are too fussy too martha stewart i just cant see brontes rochester abiding such martha stewart domestic arrangements orson welles rochester lived in cavelike gloom very appropriate to the novels gothic moodand yet  with all those objections  not only is this the best jane eyre ive seen it may be the best adaptation of any novel ive ever seenthis jane eyre in spite of its technical flaws brought the feeling back to me of reading jane eyre for the first timethe critics of this production say it is too close to the book for me someone who valued the book and didnt need it to be any less wordy or any less christian or any more sexed up this versions faithfulness to the novel bronte actually wrote is its finest assetbronte wrote a darn good book theres a reason it has lasted  years plus while other slicker sexier and easier texts have disappearedas a long time jane eyre fan i was prejudiced against timothy dalton as rochester rochester is famously not handsome jane and rochester are literatures famous ugly couple and timothy dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsomebut dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as rochester he just blew me away ive never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role the text the dialogue and rochesters love for jane dalton brings the pages rochester to quivering life on screenrochester is meant to be a bit scary dalton is scary welles got the scary streak down too for example when he shouts enough after fontaine plays a short piano piece but dalton is scary more than once here you really cant tell if hes going to hurt jane or himself in his desperationrochesters imperiousness his humor his rage his vulnerability dalton conveys all sometimes seconds apart its stunningand heres the key thing  the actor performing rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair lonely living with an ugly lifedestroying secretno other actor ive seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as timothy dalton does current fan favorite toby stephens doesnt even try dalton hits it out of the park if i saw timothy dalton performing rochester in a singles bar i would say that guy is trouble dont even look at him hes that radioactive with tamped down agonyzelah clarke is not only overall the best jane ive seen shes one of the very few janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts jane no folks who know jane eyre only from the  version bronte did not describe a statuesque robust jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips rather charlotte brontes jane is indeed poor plain obscure and little and not prettyzelah has a small mouth closeset eyes and a bit of a nose shes truly little she is no fashion model and she is the best jane the truest to the booksome described her a cold or boring no shes true to the book brontes jane is not a red hot mama shes a sheltered deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments as zelahs do here the books jane is someone you have to watch slowly carefully patiently observantly if you want to truly plumb her depths you have to watch zelah here to get to know who she really isi would have liked to have seen more fire in zelah in one key scene but thats one scene out of five hours in which she is otherwise very goodin spite of its closeness to the text this version like every other version ive seen shys away from fully explicating the overtly christian themes in jane eyre christianity is not incidental subtext in jane eyre it is centralhelen burns instructs jane in christianity thus giving her a subversive counter cultural way to read and live her apparently doomed pinched life it is christianity and a christian god who convinces poor plain obscure jane of her equal worth her need to live up to her ideals and her rejection of a key marriage proposal that isnt made fully clear herein any case charlotte bronte wrote an excellent complex rich novel and this adaptation of it of all the ones ive seen mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation ive seen and that says a lotother versions that dont fully honor the book end up being a chore to watch in many places if you dont care about what charlotte bronte has to say about child abuse or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between jane and rochesterthis version like brontes novel realizes that everything bronte wrote  about janes experiences at lowood and her relationship to st john  are part of what makes janes relationship to rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is, Error: The size of tensor a (1079) must match the

            "Error processing text: there are many adaptations of charlotte bronts classic novel jane eyre and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best the short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a  min length consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel the tv series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroines lifethere are three tv mini series released in   and  the  version is not only the worst of these three but the worst of all jane eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film the novels beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel what it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the rochester and jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set it is a silly soap opera in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the ies by mistake this jane eyre as it dares to call itself is indeed a slap in the face of charlotte brontthe  version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between mr rochester and jane are rendered in nearly their full length but what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen at times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by janes voiceovers add to the impression of artificiality and staginess and despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured another problem is the casting of the main characters sorcha cusacks portrayal of jane as a bold selfconfident worldlywise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model and michael jayston although a good actor does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play rochester although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audienceall the faults of the  version stand corrected in the tv mini series of  with timothy dalton and zelah clarke although from a purists point of view timothy dalton is too handsome tall and lean to be rochester he possesses the essential qualities for the role he has an imposing physical presence great magnetism and an air of selfassurance and authority and despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of thornfield convincingly but the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of rochesters character of all the actors who have played rochester he is the only one to capture them all rochesters harshness nearly insolence his moodiness and abruptness as well as his humorous side his tenderness his solicitude and deep frantic love daltons handling of charlotte bronts language is equally superb even rochesters most farfetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when dalton delivers them he is the definitive rochester unsurpassed and unsurpassable and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actorzelah clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of rochester she portrays exactly the jane of the novel an outwardly shy reserved and guarded young woman but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will she catches beautifully the duality in janes character her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong she and dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delightas regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the  version but with one important difference the dialogues are shortened in this version but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of charlotte bronts language and in contrast to the earlier bbc version the essence of each scene is perfectly capturedthe plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the  series it is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of janes life it is the only jane eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel and the only one which does full justice to the novels pivotal and most heartrending scene when jane and rochester meet after the aborted wedding timothy dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill he renders with almost painful intensity rochesters anguish as he realizes janes resolution to leave him his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him it is a heartbreaking almost devastating scene which will stay with the viewer for a long timewith even the smaller roles perfectly cast an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true jane eyre, Error:

            "Error processing text: hollywood hotel has relationships to many films like ella cinders and merton of the movies about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or nonexistent in fact as i was watching it tonight on turner classic movies i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic singing in the rain may have taken some of their ideas from hollywood hotel most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screenhollywood hotel is a fascinating example of movie making in the s among the supporting players is louella parsons playing herself and despite some negative comments ive seen she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines she is not the only real person in the script makeup specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble anotherthis film also was one of the first in the career of young mr ronald reagan playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes  particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important peopledick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodmans band the beginning of this film by the way is quite impressive as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell they end up singing hooray for hollywood the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the makeup king rin tin tin and even a hint of tarzan but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of th century fox and the name donald duck was substituted in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodmans orchestra at their best so did a later five minute section of the film where the band is rehearsingpowell leaves the band and his girl friend frances langford and goes to hollywood only to find he is a contract player most likely for musicals involving saxophonists he is met by allen joslyn the publicist of the studio the owner is grant mitchell joslyn is not a bad fellow but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel which is also where the studios temperamental star lola lane lives with her father hugh herbert her sister mabel todd and her sensible if cynical assistant glenda farrell lane is like jean hagen in singing in the rain except her speaking voice is good her version of dan lockwood is one alexander dupre alan mowbray scene stealing with ease several times the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was and lane when not wrapped up in her ego is fully aware of it having a fit on being bypassed for an outofthe ordinary role she wanted she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film joslyn finds a double for her lolas real life sister rosemary lane and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the followup party but she attends with powell joslyn wanting someone who doesnt know the real lola this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself but otherwise the evening is a success and when the two are together they start finding each other attractivethe complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell and his gang of hoodlums powells contract is bought out working with photographer turned agent ted healey actually not too bad in this film  he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point the two try to find work ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto eventually powell gets a break by being hired to be dupres singing voice in a ripoff of gone with the wind this leads to the final section of the film when rosemary lane herbert and healey help give powell his chance to show its his voice not mowbraysits quite a cute and appealing film even now the worst aspects are due to its time several jokes concerning africanamericans are no longer tolerable while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood healey accidentally photographs a porter and mentions to joslyn to watch out powell photographs too darkly  get the point also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane who is shall we say too high strung is not very tolerable either herberts hoohooing is a bit much too much of the time but it was really popular in  and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere this was one of his last films reminds people of the tragic still mysterious end of the comedian in december  but most of the film is quite good and wont disappoint the viewer

            "Error processing text: which do you think the average person would know moreless about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahis latest film entitled offside a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around ones right to do something or go somewhere and an individuals right to extend that courtesy if and when theyd like to the odd thing is you dont come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless its an education in panahis controversial style but you do come away feeling enlightened that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit iti can remember the  world cup im sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain  when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeriaanyone in britain that was watching the bbcs broadcast of the iran  mexico game both nations first of the tournament may remember that at the top of the show the bbcs football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match it went something like weve seen giants germany england argentina and holland play but now we get to seemexico and iran battle it out the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore its a shame because there are people and films like offside present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their wellbeing to achieve it and its sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem inferior when there are others whod do anything to have the chance to otherwise engagewhen immediately thinking of the words iran football and world cup my mind flies back to the france  game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around irans famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing irans victory as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they defeat a western power or enemy at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so ina couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are  indian film lagaan in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket similalry s the game of their lives sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the  world cup the differences between these films and offside are immense offside is looking at a situation behind a states mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men may not will but may use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a mans right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a womans right to see the game all together  it is no wonder panahis film was itself banned in iranbut panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human bodymind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match panahi pays special attention to the title of his film offside which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an attacker is caught trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the womens position in the film as these advancing supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itselfi think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that ive seen its a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neorealist aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrongdoers who dared to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons ive mentioned shows a distinct level of callous either that or you work in the iranian government, Error: The size of tensor a (1054) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: love hurts that i think is the main message mike binders newest film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they cant free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay characterbased and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how  effected us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regretthis is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish pentup anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the juvenility of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and potty humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punchdrunk love and mike binder has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on  that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became reclusive and started to believe he couldnt remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family he goes through life with his ipod and headphones shutting out everything so as not to be tempted rememberreign over me is not about charlie fineman though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life evolves into something he hasnt felt in  years he revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family cheadles character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and sandlers doesnt mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the faade they have created for themselvesthe supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads jada pinkett smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true liv tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writerdirector mike binders role as sandlers old best friend and accountant my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful saffron burrows she is a great actress and plays the love crushed divorce trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to comebinder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did binder feel the need to use the inferior eddie veddar remake for the end i dont know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope,

yet all told dbd represents the mature spirit wed love to see more of in the hk mainstreamit also marks the heralded return of edison chen long absent since the initial d debacle of a year ago chens reserved machismo does wonders for the movie yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee whose knack for alternating between physical comedy crazy n the city no problem  and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role weve seen from him since made in hong kongtogether the duo makes dog bite dog and hopefully edisons going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence his touch transformed projects from princess d to the infernal affairs saga and still he remains a rare occurrencemostly upon commencing dbd showcases some mesmerizing imagery playing gorgeous tricks with light shadow and perspective the soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer matt chow previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes dog bite dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the cornerrest assured though this isnt a horror movie instead following a path trodden before by classic one nite in mongkok albeit from a miles more perverse angle replacing daniel wus reluctant mainland assassin character we have edison playing a nameless killing machine hailing from cambodias underworld sent hong kongway to execute a single target the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the films brilliant visualsalthough weaned from childhood to become a professional killer edisons eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up on by a cid team sent to investigate this assembly features a nice cameo by mobmovie stalwart lam suet and good support from tv star wayne lai

police corruption background evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensuesa minor body count transpires as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a nono theres quite the violence quotient in store even though gore per se feels toned down in places and adult language only makes a token appearance once more no nudity leading one to conclude cat iiis are being handed these days a bit hastily still dbds a relatively mature theatrical release and we applaud its arrivalin between the fighting stabbing  hacking and shooting even a career murderer needs some romance and just like daniel wu had cecilia cheung in one nite so does intrepid mr chen get a sweetheart done beautifully by new comer pei pei her unnamed character lots of anonymity in this one meets edisons at a strangely deserted landfill abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape when the killer ditches hk he agrees to take her with him and they go on the run together

chest but these are highly forgivablemarking triumphant returns for two young talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the citys movie heyday to come back dog bite dog doesnt stand

            "Error processing text: i approach films about talking animals with care for every wonderful one like babe you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound the incredible journey or in the case of cats  dogs you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential when i heard about paulie the premise of a wisecracking parrot didnt exactly fill me with confidence but i found the film a pleasant surprise and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realisinga russian janitor misha vilyenkov tony shaloub gets a job in a research laboratory one day he hears singing coming from the basement and when he investigates he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out misha becomes fascinated with the bird especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing it can talk and not a few phrases either its a parrot you can actually make conversation withthe parrot is called paulie voiced by jay mohr and recognises a fellow castaway in misha wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story which all began when he was a baby and in the care of marie a five year old girl with a stutter the two of them became birds of a feather ok bad punwhen maries parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird they considered sending him away and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly desperate to be reunited with her paulie begins a long journey across america which includes a diverse number of new owners flying great distances and even ending up behind bars of a cage that ispaulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late s and although it wasnt afforded the same recognition or boxoffice success of babe paulie succeeds on quite a few levels and is an occasional work of striking intelligencejay mohrs standup style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie he never plays the part as too smug even if he is a bit of a smart aleck paulies worldly but he is also naive in his waybecause hes lived a rather sheltered life with marie when hes taken away he has to fend for himself for the first time and when he falls into the hands of different owners they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie which he believes only for those promises to be broken time and againpaulie is admittedly a little episodic it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie he first winds up in a pawn shop where he is adopted by ivy gena rowlands a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners she sympathises with paulies situation and drives an rv across america to find mariepaulie is an occasionally very touching film his scenes with ivy are some of the best wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers the way she instills in him the need for hope is great and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thoughtprovoking there are things in life you put off because you think youre gonna do them later but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a laterthe scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heartrending moment and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the films overdespite the occasional sad moment there are plenty of laughs to be had paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number and paulie even gets to have a romance which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief played by mohr as well that may be the only complaint i have as soon as you get comfortable with one situation the film then moves paulie on to anotherthe scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny but a little disturbing too im amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film and paulies diamond robbery is very mission impossible hes caught in the act and shipped off to the lab for animal testing where hes remained ever sincethe story finally comes full circle at the lab where misha vows to help paulie of course they do find marie but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity i was left numb for several minutes paulie may never get the longevity babe has but i believe its an equally brilliant film the same laughs the same flawless effects and the same surprising intelligencea minor gem, Error: The size of tensor a (971) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: beforehand notification im sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when i saw the preview for this movie i was thinking finally i have yet to see one movie about popular africaninfluenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was a black woman ive seen an excessive amount of movies where a nonblack woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it breakin breakin  save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop africaninfluenced dance and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasnt always men who performed it so i felt this movie has been a long time coming however the race does not make the film so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watchpros i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture i cant recall ever seeing a popular mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican had believable accents and werent stereotypical with the beanies the steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main characters sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didnt make the plot stereotypical i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed i loved the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main characters parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the fellas i dont see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black filmscons im not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but i question whether theyve been to real step shows whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers handfeet beats at a real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers hands and feet it was awkward i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus stomp the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in stomp the yard meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the deltas let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music i know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks couldve played the music in other parts of the filmim not a keyshia cole fan so every time i saw her all i kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me i thought they shouldve used a host like free or rocsi instead deray davis was funny as usual though also i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldnt possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to doi wouldve given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs, Error: The size of tensor a (793) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say thisits wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approachplotsimply stated its not boring most hollywood movies give tried and true plots that they know will connect with people often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched the weather man and lord of war and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they dont take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after youve watched a fair amount of american films dominos plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man theyre screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the moviecharactersi felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish thatchoco was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to dominos lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the teamthey all rang true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realisticrourkes character was the least interesting to me but it still rang true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope thats what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because thats what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to liveclaremontladies i believe that they provided much needed heart to the story they werent just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this childs illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed helpthe mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interestingchristopher walken guysthey provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from walkens awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the  guys being hasbeens their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyablecinematographyyesthe cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and congratulate scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the look of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isnt as peachy or clean as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and werent just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie werent expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and im glad that scott tried to make something differentgranted this movie isnt for everyone but to say its trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and im glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but im sure it will only hit a chord with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the sphere of mtv wont appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously, Error: The size of tensor a (1050) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: titanic directed by james cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the titanic the plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense the end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however kate winslett is wonderful as rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by cal billy zane early on the voyage rose meets jack leonardo dicaprio a lower class artist on his way to america after winning his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the titanic primarily through their eyesthe movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the titanic which has recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic rose dewitt bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this the scene shifts to southhampton ireland where the titanic set sail from on april   as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the titanics legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april   at  an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate the crew of titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until  when the lights finally failed the lights of the california were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanics many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanicmany of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose jack cal and roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time yet many characters such as the unsinkable molly brown captain edward smith the ship designer thomas andrew the white star line representative bruce ismay and all of the titanics officers were real the maiden voyage was going to be captain edward smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since  where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaires captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonenglish speaking nations in addition officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the strauss not wanting to leave her husbands side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic furthermore mr goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best the richest man on the ship john jacob astor who owned most of manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat in addition molly brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the carpethia that picked the survivors of titanic up from the water her ticket on the titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke all of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware the gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs the wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the postvictorian era of  the rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet women during this time often married for financial security as rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as cal wished for rose to do the rich did not take well to new money such as molly brown as depicted everything of the time was very formal women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with rose in the movie men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society although james cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the titanic and few liberties were taken the beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakinga recognizable message can be seen in the movie titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise the director james cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the titanic on that fateful night in addition this film is a reflection of the s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the titanic only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual titanic been found and explored this movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed however the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed there have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in titanic but all have failed as it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this mattertechnically the film is very well done to get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie in addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside titanic as anyone has in the  years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of titanic to the scene of titanic during its actual voyage this shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner at the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the european coast on titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmtitanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture certain aspects of this film are academy award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing if you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you, Error: The size of tensor a

titanic live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a wellwritten story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film  times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day, Error: The size of tensor a (1018) must

economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseballlikewise an occasional excursion of  or  hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyones house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to worlds events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh realitythe literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful  color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviouslythe newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visualnarrative method of story tellingthe other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borroughs tarzan and johnston mcculleys zorro the s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger gs battle aces and the spidermaster of men all found their way to the news stands among many othersone other was doc savage a fullblooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super herohe also assembled  of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologistarchaeologistpaleontologist etcthe doc savage stories were very popular in the s and s and were published into the middle s then they went into a hiatus for a good  years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirtthe reintroduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over  years before any real project got put together it was veteran stopaction animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brotherswhen doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tvron elys nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this casethe story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the storyfrom the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of docs with a miniature rocketmissile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pals being the producerhis last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a scifi action setting of the pulp characters worldi can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our nd child michelle our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre rd  kedzie here in chicagohaving seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mrpal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulpcomicserial type excitementand yet the cast headedup by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyoneand maybe thats just what they were trying for with this doc savage man of bronze, Error: The size of tensor a (1062) must match the size of tensor b

even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums and of course they have to be mexican obviously his good will towards his fellow man backfires in that case it wasnt too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums but i like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldnt be ignored im reminded of the episode of michael moores brilliant the awful truth when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay the results were not very promising so its nice to see someone in the movies setting a good examplejim carrey plays the part of bruce nolan the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart or even better it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere a little metaphor that comes up when bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film bruce is nearly  years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery thats seeking to bake the worlds biggest cookie hes desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the tv station but he loses his cool on live tv when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague you have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report needless to say he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scenes of the entire filmmorgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the man himself displaying a god whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through freemans massive talent as an actor he is the kind of god who takes his job very seriously but in such a way as to advise his followers as well as the viewers of this movie that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life i love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day there are a lot of people in the world maybe more than our share in america who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humansone of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewers religion i for example tend to reject organized religion in all forms and i see god and satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live but despite the fact that i dont believe that god exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time i was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this moviejim carreys movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far hes come if you compare bruce almighty with movies like ace ventura both of which i loved by the way or a lot of what he did before he got into film its amazing how far hes come he has moved from cheesy tv comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like the truman show man on the moon and the majestic easily one of his greatest films ever jim carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working todayjennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as she did in the sidesplitting office space as bruces girlfriend who becomes increasingly exasperated by bruces growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him there is definitely some lowbrow comedy in the film that doesnt really fit with the importance of the films meaning or the quality of the delivery such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene but it was definitely pretty nice to see ace venturas friend spike make a cameo appearance as stephen king very well knows its always nice to see familiar characters its almost like seeing family againbruce is endowed with the powers of god for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him the thing i love about this is that like i said before religion is absent from my life but i was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things i would have done had i been endowed with such powers the movie allows us to learn vicariously this way which empowers the message even morethe scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film such as the scene when bruce loses his temper about the anchor position the jimmy hoffa scene who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records the scene where bruces rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera and my favorites the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakerys cooking the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent jokes such as when he says to god who reveals that hes the janitor the proprietor the electrician etc that his christmas parties must be real bashes and to be careful about drinking because on of him might need a ride home i also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes a little too true and as gallagher would add behind every great man is also an amazed motherinlawbruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while and is probably the only directly religious that i can remember seeing that i am anxious to buy on dvd to add to my personal collection it is a comedy written and performed in good taste but with enough relatively lowbrow humor to keep the kids entertained this is a meaningful comedy for the whole family which is becoming rarer and rarer these days in a world that is about to be flogged with yet another american pie film and another scary movie which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy its nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching dont miss this one, Error: The size of tensor a (1354) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer today a writer and journalist has put forward the theory that just as british filmmakers in the eighties were often critical of what they called thatchers britain the ealing comedies were intended as satires on attlees britain the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the  general election this theory was presumably not intended to apply to say kind hearts and coronets which is if anything a satire on the edwardian upper classes or to the ladykillers or the lavender hill mob both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature it can however be applied to most of the other films in the series especially passport to pimlicopimlico is or at least was in the forties a predominantly workingclass district of london set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station it is not quite correct to say as has often been said that the film is about pimlico declaring itself independent of britain what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy this means that technically pimlico is an independent state and has been for nearly five hundred years irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not applybecause pimlico is not subject to british law the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please unhindered by the rationing laws when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised blackmarketeering and seal off the area to try and force the burgundians as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves to surrendermany of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system either as an individual as happens in the man in the white suit or the lavender hill mob or as part of a larger community as happens in whisky galore or the titfield thunderbolt the central theme of passport is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and governmentimposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties the films particular target is the rationing system during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in  and organisations such as the british housewives league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the films satire were the spivs black marketeers who play a relatively minor part in the action or the housewives league who do not appear at all the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats who are portrayed either as having a rules for rules sake mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at alli suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino indeed i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film in  however four years after the end of the war the filmmakers were keen stress patriotism and british identity so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain one of the bestknown lines from the film is we always were english and we always will be english and its just because we are english that were sticking up for our right to be burgundians there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristicsmost of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave but in the last scene after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain global warming may have altered things slightly but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief whatever statistics might say to the contrary that britain had an abnormally wet climate the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally importantthere is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton the grocer and smalltime local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor in the main however this is appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film it lacks the illwill and rancour of many more recent satirical films but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and with the possible exception of kind hearts and coronets is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies , Error: The size of tensor a (1074) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

were all alone in the world what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes in fact the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew two roommates living in a rundown house in the middle of a freeway system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed just untilstraight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happensthe rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of nothingness at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still leftnothing features an incredibly small cast  in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david hewlett and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of closeup head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it but we dont see it right awayobviously this cant be an event driven film and its not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy barnow one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two lads due to the properties of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of tofu as andrew claims its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little societyone of the best parts of the film is the set production designer jasna stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watchinghowever the very best part of the film is the acting both david hewlett and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent oneliners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end  and this really moves the movie away from the lowbudget area to wellcrafted handworklets talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment  they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appearnothing is a bright and welllit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we dont know where they are or what has happened to them we dont know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it couldve been its rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end its a reasonably satisfactory onetake hollow man kill bill cube epoch and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an amalgam of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and andr bijelic having been roommates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end its almost like one of the cube prequelswhat can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely wellmade with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing  i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to befinal rating   , Error: The size of tensor a (1236) must match the size of tensor b (512) at

that they are either white clouds or black clouds meaning that with the latter all kinds of fires follow the probie the former means that very little fire activity follows but one day there will be the mother of all fires tony is a white cloud after some initial growing pains tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet then the unthinkable occursseptember   begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street because jules has had little camera experience gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief t k pfeiffer arriving at about  the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene and as jules pans upwards we see the first strike of the day american airlines flight  smashes into the face of the north tower of  world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center once there jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him once inside the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area once there he captures the impact of the second plane united airlines flight  with  world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the crowds reaction to the unimaginable gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan inside tower one jules records the last view the world or loved ones will have of their sons fathers uncles grandfathers husbands boyfriends friends as one by one each firefighter carrying  lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up  stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother kevin as he leaves to do his selfless duty also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is respectful never once does he capture a sensationalistic momentthe money shot his work is professional through his baptism of fire he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd the chaplain for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two tower one begins its structural collapse what results is a breathtakingly poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day not knowing if either is alive each fearing the worst as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion jules and gideon are reunited as jules cries on his brothers shoulder gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos who left the station with a former chief is believed to have been lostbut returns to the fold this probie has proven himselfshown with only three interruptions  is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject in lesser hands the tendency would be toward the sensational but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion narrated by hanlon we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september  robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is it isnt about dribbling a basketball or selling an album of hate lyrics is about humanity at its best heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom , Error: The size of tensor a

            "Error processing text: this is a superbly imaginative low budget scifi movie from cult director vincenzo natali the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen the film is superbly shot i love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original plotwise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple scifi stuff morgan sullivan jeremy northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp a large technological corporation he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife after his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu he takes an instant attraction to however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies sullivan whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a braindead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp make sullivan a double agent they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that foster works for sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires the cast are great northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent he brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact the rest of the cast are also gooddirector natali whose previous film was the cult classic scifi flick cube has a real visual flair he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isnt great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great scifi films it is up there with them the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states , Error: The size of tensor a (994) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: canadian director vincenzo natali took the arthouse circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions ive been eagerly awaiting natalis followup and although its taken five years for him to mount another project im delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one mans place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his controli dont want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of cypher is the different avenues it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in its head cypher is such a filmmorgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company digicorp they send him to different parts of america to record different seminars to his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheesewhile morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into rita foster an impeccably cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brushoff but there is something to her he finds irresistible thats not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in when rita turns up at another one of morgans seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears and im not saying anything more about the plot to do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path thats so much fun to followas with cube natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when theyre thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but its not a carbon copy of cube it has its own inspirationcypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle its as much of a shock to us as it is to himone thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns cypher is also on a low budget but natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identitynatalis direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day filmnoirthe acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because its so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identitydavid hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because its an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in identifying doubleagents and its a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by hewlett all he has to do is look at morgan and were drawn into his complex mind gamebut its lucy liu whos the scene stealer here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that liu inhabits with relish i perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alonethings come to a very gratifying end that doesnt conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after hes been put through the ringer like this i cheered for him in the final scene its a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy  minutescypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining its everything that total recall wanted to be but wasnt and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrixa fine followup from natali and now im a committed fan of the man superb stuff, Error: The size of tensor a (996) must match the size

to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicitthe action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the authors writing to provide a template where the readers imagination andor past experience flourish angelopoulos drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the nonverbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so farthe music by angelopoulos long time collaborator eleni karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos genius through arvanitis camera is on display throughout the filmthe suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the sociopolitical situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although angelopoulos political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees plights in the process angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century greece and he likes to bring lessons from the hellenic myths into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined homeric and dantesque tradition of odysseus travel alexander is a telemachus in search of a story about an aging greek politicianodysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not alexanders father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figureodysseus as with homers telemachus alexander grows as a person during his odysseyof course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of homers odyssey in a contemporary context angelopoulos draws on odysseuss travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film in angelopoulos ending odysseus is more like the dantes odysseus he does not leave for ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase and alexandertelemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voiceover at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from dantes inferno and dont forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away finally although angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a greek orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellowsuited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the christlike figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the byzantine iconographys influence in angelopoulos work they appear like stylites religious figures found in the orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticismthe film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wifes statement its not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary on this account angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble, Error: The size of tensor a (1120) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

see if i could find something i hadnt seen beforei didnt thats because its so real to meanother user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary im all for that  its absolutely obvious that most of these people whove made comments about midnight cowboy may not have been born when it was released they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time ill be just as ruinously frank i am yearsold if youre familiar with some of my other comments youll be aware that i was a professional femaleimpersonator for  of those years and also have appeared in film  youd never recognize me even if you were familiar with my nightclub persona do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film  you bet i do and am not the least bit ashamed if you havent runinto some of them its your loss  but theres a huge chance you have but just didnt know it so many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you it should be no secret many actorsactresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy who is to judge  i can name several current bigtime stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and werent the least bit damaged by their time spent there i make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are  love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks likethe trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem  he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles  how do you think he gets his input i can also name lots of malestars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money although the nightclub i last worked in for  years was worldfamous and legit i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our backstreet looking to make a pickupthis should be no surprise today although its definitely action in hollywood and other cities large and small wakeup and smell the roses they smell no less sweet because they are of a different huesome of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend i didnt find any incidence of that believeitornot kids havent always had their own rooms  because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be goingon in the masterbedroom whose business hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users pointout that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy  his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed  no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hipi also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe  they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship  true friendship if you didnt understand that at the end of the movie then youve wasted your time joes bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight deserved an oscar for this role  one that john wayne could never pulloff and he was as handsome in his youthhoffman is hoffman  you expect fireworks he gave them superbly wayne got his oscar every character in this film was beautifully defined  if you dont think they are still around you are mistaken the party   attend some of the raves younger people attendif you can get in look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs  youll see every outrageous personalitybrenda viccaro was the epitome of societys sleek women who have to get down to the nittygritty at times if you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isnt real look at todays ladies who live on the brink of disreputeand are admired for itthe brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life you dont have to condone it but its not too much different than any violence joe pointedly named his purpose  in that situation id have handedover the money quicker than he asked for it thats one of the scenes that makes this movie a breakthrough one which i do not watch i get heartbroken for bothjohn schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eyeopener waldo salt didnt write from clairvoyance anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other moviemakers make no compunction in presenting it to the public not looking doesnt mean it isnt there  give me the truth every

hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it isbut unlike passenger  and under siege which are decent die hard clones on their own terms cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaksyears before other movies like a simple plan and fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations cliffhanger director renny harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundingsthe opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening not even harlins shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in deep blue sea or the ridiculous expression on ralph waites face can dim the sequences powerthe next impressive setpiece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet as written by stallone and michael france and directed by harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody doublecrosses are completely unexpected as roger ebert has observed the stuntman who made the midair transfer between the planes deserves some special recognitionlater during the avalanche sequence one of the terroriststhieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain so far as i know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot but the shot itself remains impressive because were left wondering how harlin or more likely one of the secondunit directors knew exactly where to place the cameraill take sly stallone as my action hero any day of the week because hes one of the few movie stars ive ever seen whos completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain the role of gabe walker really complements stallones acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively lowkey performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himselfin contrast to many of todays postmatrix comic bookinspired action heroes stallones walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computerenhanced abilities in cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another he winces when hes hit and bleeds when hes cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a rockystyle pummeling from one of the maddog villainsit should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movies effectiveness when i first saw this movie as a teenager i was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point i actually cheered as one of the most coldblooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demiselithgows british accent is as unconvincing as the movies occasional model plane or model helicopter but hes fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages stallone and rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says you stay you fetch even a better actor such as anthony hopkins might have had trouble with that lineeven if cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining showearly in the movie for example lithgow openly says to one of his men retire stallone when he comes down no real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows rooker to shout a warning up to sly on the rock face and this precipitates a gripping tugofwar between stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leglithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadnt given rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captordone very much in the style of a saturday matinee serial or at times a western cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser filmbesides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with really fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already actionpacked narrative finally harlins decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenesits a shame that stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably i wonder what he would be like years later but perhaps its best that cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already there was an unofficial sequel that called itself vertical limit compared to that clinker cliffhanger belongs on the imdbs top  listrating  very good especially considering most of stallones other movies, Error: The size of tensor a (1132) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text:  slight spoilers way back before evangelion was made before hideaki anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite gunbuster was made with only wings of honneamise made by gainax at that time and the famous otakon shorts or course gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up it didnt make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space operaluckily gainax decided to put it out as a sixpart oav direct to video series this allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film this also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in macross or gundam and many other popular space operasfor one the shows starts out pretty light with noriko in the okinawa high school for mechapiloting noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid this makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that noriko is favored by the professors the first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and noriko and kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet outthe middle bulk of gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action a couple more characters are introduced and parts of norikos past are dragged up again besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the gunbuster mankinds final hope is presented smart as writer okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit in short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light this means that noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her the science might not be perfect but its presented in a pretty believable way with even some sd science theatre shorts in between the episodes where noriko kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the seriesthe animation for a series made in the s is definitely good the designs are retro s style of course but it has its charm animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betraysome of the fanservice fascination gainax will later exploit to the fullest the mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast the last episode was entirely done in black and white while its generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter partthe music is very typical space opera fair too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying it does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series hes worked on is dragon half if you think s anime music you will know what to expectas the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row neither aspect is ever left completely out though with the last episode in sight noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee selfpreservation while they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought the last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course again it fits the seriesgunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is but it is done exceptionally well for a change instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshedout characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon the show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided overall the trip gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one it might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws, Error: The size of tensor a (1017) must match the size of tensor b (512) at

            "Error processing text: horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesnt always win out over imagination we all know that killers like freddy jason michael and even leatherface shouldnt be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us dont believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains and lets hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them this is where imagination wins out over fact horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow this usually isnt a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville but what i do have a problem digesting  without wanting to regurgitate  is when a film has a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is but the  minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough if the film would have offered me a different killer then i would actually be raving about it this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with mejohn cassevetes plays dr sam cordell he and his daughter jenny  played beautifully by erin flannery  have just recently moved to this small new england town cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman  one can only presume it is his wife  is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed again i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan he has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene he just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film i guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to cassevetes himself there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the getgo the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank once she is there she is attacked the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in he looks frantically scours the room and spots his wouldbe lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct notealso introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galenthroughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped this is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement it just didnt strike the right chordthe incubus is a well done film it is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders but when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones  out of  this could have been a nine too bad, Error: The size of tensor a (1105)

melancholic roles this opinion however does not resemble neorealist movies in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these  years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past at the same time while being based on the novel by james m cain the postman always rings twice it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which id like to entail belowfirst viscontis movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face gino massimo girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern although many people go there to have a meal gino occurs to get something more  much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna clara calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar mr giuseppe bragana juan de landa her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together however are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire can one build love upon murder what is love and what is loyalty does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters we have to love each other affectionately answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything isnt it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that its not therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart yet it constantly remains thought provokingsecond ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost  years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of ragazza perfetta perfect girl a dancer anita and buys her ice cream his desires show him totally different direction do viewers remain indifferent at ginogiovannas first meeting the first focus of camera is on giovannas legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious lookthird ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo elio marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona clara calamai who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple they are both very convincing besides i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art in some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performancein sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity in such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely fellinis style too visconti always had something to convey what did he want to say here is the film against bad marriage or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire the final shocking moments say for themselves though you dont have to agree with the vision ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film one of viscontis best , Error: The size of tensor a (1011) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings charting the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns their fetishistic love of them their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombsso what is the movie trying to say what is really motivating these soon to be killers it seems hard to really pinpoint they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level how above the rest of us they are and how they will leave us all behind like the columbine killers they truly feel superior like nietzsches res sentiment cal and andres value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society yet we are given only glimpses of this an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example so where is the motivation what i feel is that coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise this is why in part school shooters seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes the murder is part of a fantasy cal and andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions they turn fantasy into tragedywhat is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique dependence cal and andre have on each other andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two cals embrace of his demeanour and attire seem somewhat forced andre is uptight andre is intense and serious he completely shuns others except for his family he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school yet he is likable in his own way he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him yet these moments are shattered by andres fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both confidante and potential victim cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than andre more accepting of reality yet he is in his own way dominant we have many personal moments of introspection with cals video diary scenes when he is alone and apart from andre cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to exorcise himself of them andre is jealous of cal going to the prom with an old friend he wants cal all to himself cal placates andre and encourages him for the first time in his life andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he cannot lose it whilst cal has found someone offering him a way outthe movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion there is an excellent moment when cal attends the high school prom suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and introverted not at all at ease with his peers yet we are inclined to feel more connection with cal than with the raucous bawdy crowd screaming juvenile obscenities whilst drinking heavily in their limo theirs is an episode all too common and recognisable we do not want to relate to them when it is over and cal is back with andre silently preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created we feel like shunning the masses as they havethe penultimate scene is superb the final video sees andre and cal arming themselves in their car just moments before attacking it is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom by know we know cal and andre and are realising they are about to actually do it with a kind of morbid fascination we are also relishing the films catharsisthe massacre shot in cctv fashion is at times shocking and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws what is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of cal and andre looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the callous killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would it is violent and real our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy which costs them everythingthe final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses erected for andre and cal in disgust that they have been memorialised having known andre and cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anythingzero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts sensationalised by the media it is a character study well worth

naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end dali and bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull offthe film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from a to b to c some mishmash about a professor walterman  his first name mind you  who was bitten by a yeti monster during an expedition to tibet and hasnt been the same since which is understandable one of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted doctor wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him but its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beastwalterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thighhigh nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife the lady with the nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing look what a beautiful day it is la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mara zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his  year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschys previous movies mark of the wolfman the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie post production was a nightmare nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a prerelease screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curbyet somehow the film works if you let it it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesnt make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and hes howling at the full moon then its raining again and yet you dont look at it as a gaffe its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness  i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend it is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does its easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it the trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effectpaul naschy died last week at the age of  he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in madrid spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment his rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe even people who dont like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots you can find it for free at archiveorg or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel its worth far far moreamusingly naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but i will say this id rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekendthe world lost a great artist this month watch his films and remember, Error: The size of tensor a (1103) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: bill crains rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesnt follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons  a sin thats virtually unacceptable in most posthalloween genre pieces but theres still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that youve grown to expect just as wally kozs surprisingly decent  was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director looking through the credits i noticed numerous crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature but despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as im sure youll agree is hardly the most exciting location with that said though i must admit that theres certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way chris jennifer mcallister and her boyfriend greg kenny johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies trip kevin mcparland and mary nicole anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dunelike wilderness gregs older brother kyle todd schaefer and his buxom girlfriend bambi laura albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle doesnt seem too keen to forget sound like a motive for a massacre well what did you expect before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature i dont even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others mirage certainly doesnt appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine judging by the credible work behind the camera id have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when its necessary r christopher biggs gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent  rating a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck theres also some black humor thats surely unintentional we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killers boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters but when hes revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and teds bogus journey i didnt quite know what to expect thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadisticallythere are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and bg steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesnt come at the cost of thespian potential the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror filmmaking at its freakiestmirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job the flaws are numerous but never detract credibility from the net result unfortunately youve probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store then make sure you pick it up recommended, Error: The size of tensor a (986) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

            "Error processing text: in  director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast the result was scarface starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles the story begins in may of  when castro opened the harbor at mariel cuba to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states  left cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in america and most were honest hardworking people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted but not all among the marielitos who streamed into florida approximately  had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cubas jails criminals considered beyond redemption who castro had merely wanted to be rid of and they too saw america as a land of opportunity even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana pacino known to his associates as caracortada scarfacenow that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida he was determined to have it all wealth and power that was montanas dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez robert loggia lopez it seems had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castros goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in little havana along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives and in short order montana sees to it that lopezs brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of americalopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets montana and his friend manny steven bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work in his day capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but lopez has the modern day equivalent and its even more lucrative cocaine lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it montana isnt satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be at the top with a coldblooded iron will montana decides hell do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before its over he will realize the price for his dream and hell pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what its like to be the man and he will also know whether or not it was worth itin step with de palmas vision pacino plays montana largerthanlife and he does it beautifully from the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude hes got it all and it makes montana convincing and very real what he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors de niro would be one can this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but pacinos screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though its hard to become emotionally involved with him its quite simply a dynamic memorable performancemichelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom as elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of montanas dream pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance she like pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanorthe supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio gina miriam colon mama montana f murray abraham omar paul shenar sosa and harris yulin bernstein an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed traffic and blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpahs the wild bunch de palmas scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing but if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end and like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time but the reward is always worth it and thats the way it is with this film i

            "Error processing text: warning mild spoilersthe story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing  even moving  episode in american history and world religious history this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth ive so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showingjoseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers alvin hyrum  joseph who at a very young age needed an operation the operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parentsjosephs religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed the face of jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by josephs marriage to emmathis movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history but merely jumps from scene to scene this is not a critique  simply a note about the stylethe practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the saviors love with a scarred face from having recently been attackedthe movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the everdeepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governmentsthe film shows many scenes from josephs life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of josephs life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassionas joseph and hyrum ride to carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerfulat the end the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessedwhen i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to nonmembers i no longer think that is the case although i hope the movie can do just that as an insider i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film  whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an american religious man or something elsethe film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture  including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law  we moderns take for granted, Error: The size of tensor a (604) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",

longer large or appreciative moreover because they seem in character allens ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time watermans character also functions neatly in the plot his fake magic bodydissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel ian mcshane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim introduced on a river styx ferryboattohades strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just cant rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious tarot killer unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to watermans magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate sondra pransky scarlett johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magicians climactic trick sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father as demonstrated in lost in translation johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous byplay between her and allen is very amusing  and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romancescoops serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect peter lyman hugh jackman is the no doubt predictable result of allens lengthy sabbatical exposure to londons ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore yet other facets of scoop as of match point also derive from woodys late life encounter with english culture its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire when for instance sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club waterman observes from his point of view were scum a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering watermans insistent borschtbelt jewish plebeianism and then of course there is watermans hilarious exit in a smart car he cant remember to drive on the left side of the roadas usual allens humor in scoop includes heavy doses of injokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references for instance the films soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of griegs the hall of the mountain king compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre the postfuneral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose  references to deconstructing harry  include the use of death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of adair university harrys alma mater and where sondra is now a student moreover the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite as to quotable gags allens scripts rely less on oneliners than they did earlier in his career but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones to a question about his religion waterman answers i was born in the hebrew persuasion but later i converted to narcissism and sondra snaps off this putdown of watermans wannabe crimedetecting if we put our heads together youll hear a hollow noise all in all scoop is by far woody allens most satisfying comedy in a decade, Error: The size of tensor a (999) must match the size

in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue soon after problems began to emerge in the onetimewed lockedwatertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent the band dissolved albeit unofficially in  and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists although they have never admitted that theres any truth in those rumours the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue if you want to appeal to the largest moneymaking media market in the entire world then you must cater for english speaking audiencesits amazing for me how such a small island thats located a stonethrow away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world everyone speaks a little bit of english whether it be simply hello or a common swear word  youll find an english speaker almost everywhere pedro galindo obviously didnt agree because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd thats a real shame because its actually a decent slasher movie thats a lot better than many of its englishspeaking genre compatriotsthe film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown after some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his softspoken opponent but as of yet he hasnt succeededlater that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partnerthey plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversaryafter visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly storekeeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland hunters become hunted as they learn that the bear is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassini picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room nextdoor to me i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about  minutes before the final credits rolled which meant i never got to see the final scenes thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection gallindos slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepilymasked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panicstricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniacs playgrounddespite gallindos obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a clawfingered glove a la freddy kruegar trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown from here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry the majorettes which is not necessarily a good thingas is the case with many latin films especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewers throat over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner its a sugarcoated point but its handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the featuretrampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentinestyle mask and the attempts at originality just about work it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing,

other in various situations thats quite a problem the lady from shanghai ended up at a very low c or a  for methe lady from shanghai is really all about orson welles character michael ohara ohara sees elsa rosalie bannister rita hayworth in central park on a carriage ride and hits on her later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him ohara is a seaman from ireland and the globetrotting elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband arthur everett sloane a very famous and powerful california defense attorney they talk ohara into working for them despite his initial reservationsit seems to him and to the audience that elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and ohara doesnt want to get involvedshortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man george grisby glenn anders who says hes arthurs partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble eventually grisby asks ohara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme foolishly ohara agrees naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealedmaybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far im not exactly a huge fan of orson welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time i havent seen anywhere near the majority of welles work yet but ive tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performancearty i love f for fake vrits et mensonges  for example and i even kind of like his performance in casino royale  when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but citizen kane  never did much for me despite giving it  or  chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low the same as my current score for the lady from shanghaiwelles performance and the dialogue hes written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me hes a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotonehe tends to sound like hes reading his performance reminded me of what ive seen of welles version of moby dick listed on imdb as  but completed in  it can also be seen in orson welles the oneman band  where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that hes inherently sublimely dramatic im also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow welles manages to make his irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me tooas for the other performances i can only say i thought hayworth did an excellent job of course shes gorgeous which doesnt hurt plenty of eye candy here like welles sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to mei never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesnt seem to fit welles often shoots him in closeup and anders almost always has some overexaggerated manic expression on his sweaty facestructurally the lady from shanghai is very uneven the first  minutes or so are extremely bland and soapoperatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique once grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end but by the time the lady from shanghai becomes a crimemystery film its too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellencethe ending is more actionoriented lessdialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director if the lady from shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crimemystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a  the final scenes are easily s as welles shifts from a hitchcockian suspense scene in a san francisco chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a chinese amusement park the funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time its well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolismthe cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually cant make up for the problems in the foreground welles blocks scenes with skill there are lots of attractively filmed settings from central park to acapulco to various san francisco locations welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of acapulco to the mazelike caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the san francisco aquarium and so on the romance material for which the aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romancesurely serious welles fans will appreciate the lady from shanghai much more than i did and of course its worth a watch if you love rita hayworth the lady from shanghai isnt exactly a terrible film in my view but its dangerously close to not passing proceed with caution, Error: The size of tensor a (1078) must match the

particularly that justifiably famous fun house finale the lady from shanghai has gained a position of importance beyond its actual worth as a key to the saga of orson welles failure to conquer hollywoodby  welles position as a hollywood figure was mixed citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the hearst press and by hollywood insiders themselves welles attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre supposedly shot by robert stevenson but actually shot in large measure with stevensons blessing by welles but the credit went to stevenson only the stranger a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing nazi war criminals made a profit for five years in hollywood it was barely a great recordwelles returned to broadway in  hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of around the world in  days but despite the assistance mike todd and cole porter composing the score the musical was a failure his failure occurred just at the same time that his wife rita hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of gilda so the marriage was going on the rocks as wellwelles had to make money  his broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd which he would eventually rue and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of henri desire landru to charlie chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into monsieur verdouxthe story goes that welles with a  tax bill to worry about called cohn and offered to do a film with rita for a down payment cohn was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was it was a wise question welles was on a pay phone in new york in a pharmacy that had a book department he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai and raved that it was a great thriller somehow welles convinced the normally astute cohn that welles knew what he was talking about cohn said hed look into getting the rights and sent welles his downpayment of  after cohn hung up welles bought the book and read it  and found it was really pretty bad he spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up ritas character of elsa bannistercertainly it has a curious plot development michael ohara is a seamanlongshoreman he rescues elsa bannister when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in san francisco elsa is married to arthur bannister everett sloane a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation she convinces him to hire michael as the skipper of their yacht the cruise also contains bannisters sinister partner george grisby glenn anders and one sidney broome ted de corsia who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa when they can michael and elsa try to find time together but broome or grisby keeps showing upgrisby makes michael an offer  he wants for reasons connected to his socalled fatalistic view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead according to grisby the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the south seas he will pay michael  if he will pretend to shoot grisby this includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that grisby is probably deadof course grisby is killed and michael is arrested for that and for the murder of broome shot with michaels gun michael is tried with bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted michael is convinced that bannister is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict he is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the filmits a terribly confusing movie as i have had commented on that does not mean its not worth seeing  visually it is striking witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial judges quarters where he knocks the bailiff into the judges bookcase shattering glass or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the lecherous grisbys binocularsthe acting is pretty good in particular sloane possibly that fine actors best film role glenn anders was a leading broadway performer he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai and his slimy grisby is unforgettable also ted de corsia does very nicely with broome  a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own costas for hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before blood and sand tales of manhattan and the strawberry blond are exceptions and is a memorable siren welles ohara is a very unusual character for the actor  a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe its not kane ambersoms othello touch of evil or chimes at midnight but it is a good film for all that, Error: The size of tensor a (1077) must match the size of tensor b (512) at

            "Error processing text: sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner surely he isnt the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hardhanded and confronting but so what theyre awesomely entertaining his most famous action movies like the first three entries in the death wishseries for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres  like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example  he doesnt stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused todds brownings masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years and why just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldnt watch the movie in the first place claim its an unethical thing to do i dont suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place another major reason why critics didnt warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz novel  and thus michael winners screenplay  is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemarys baby the omen and the exorcist but lets face it s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying s horrorhighlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery youre not likely to forget easyalison parker a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already alisons physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this its truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alisons brownstone apartment is the earths gateway to hell itself and shes the chosen one to guard it because the films script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly  minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alisons own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fiances odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like alisons flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nailbiting denouements i ever witnessedthe cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isnt the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others like christopher walken jeff goldblum beverly dangelo and tom berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a mustsee for true genre fanatics, Error: The size of tensor a (939) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension

classic mr vampire jackie chan was having international success on video but it was with a chinese ghost story that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many yearswestern filmgoers had never seen anything like it it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and bestdirector siutung ching still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woos a better tomorrow the killer has under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark created a masterpiece of fantasyhorror cinema and with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than  martial arts coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkablethe editing by the amazingly prolific david wu who wrotedirected the bride with white hair  and edited such classic titles as a better tomorrow  hardboiled and the cult hit the club is quite simply a work of genius his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their artthe crew of cinematographers have also done miracles this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an everpresent ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold its a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act the sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praiseanother major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on a chinese ghost story the music is quite simply vital from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the charactersthe score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but its in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into its own here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsaushens and hsiao tsings love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful this is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a films music can haveand we of course have the acting talent leslie cheung a better tomorrow    and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector his work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocencejoey wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fatandy lau classic god of gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here she is the epitome of ethereal beauty her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths veteran actor wu ma mr vampire swordsman is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy yen he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorablebut what about the monsters and beasties i hear you cry well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motionanimatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsaushen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work most of which has to this day never been toppedbut the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirits killer tongue we first encounter this thing with an evil dead style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks but later its shown in all its crazy glory it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth its an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldnt work but it does to fantastic and unforgettable effectso what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making a true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie its a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to its enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances, Error: The size of tensor a (1165) must match the size of tensor b (512) at non-singleton dimension 1\n",
